## Features
* **KPIs:** Highlight key metrics such as patient count, average treatment cost, and bed occupancy rate.
* **Charts:** Utilize various types of charts (bar, line, pie) to represent data effectively.
* **Tooltips:** Offer additional context and insights when hovering over data points.
* **Measures:** Incorporate multiple custom measures for enhanced data analysis.
* **Slicers:** Enable interactive data filtering to drill down into specific segments.

## Dataset
